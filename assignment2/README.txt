Matlab Image Processing Toolbox

Input and output folders placed as in the handed in zip

How to run:

All code can be run by executing the main.m file in Matlab.


Code structure:

Code for the detection of corner points can be found in the
files Harris_corner_function.m and nms.m.

Code for extraction of descriptors from the image can be found
in the file extraction.m.

Code for matching the interest points and doing statistics
